STEPS TO EXECUTE:

1] open the .ipynb file in python note book and execute each cell in the program.

In the code:

1] generates the input array using random generator
2] automatically after running the sorting function, the array is sorted and output is passed onto the graph generating code
3] output graph is generated i.e input data size versus time complexity.
